Question 1. Tower of Hanoi 

Number of discs : 3
Shift disc 1 from A to C
Shift disc 2 from A to B
Shift disc 1 from C to B
Shift disc 3 from A to C
Shift disc 1 from B to A
Shift disc 2 from B to C
Shift disc 1 from A to C

Minimum number of shifts required to move the arrangement of 3 from 'A' to 'C'  is  7

 Question 2 . Pascals Triangle 

Enter number of rows: 5
BY recursion :
    1 
   1 1 
  1 2 1 
 1 3 3 1 
1 4 6 4 1 
By iteration :
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1

Question 3. Use of some inbuilt function -> callable, hash ,set methods etc.

Enter First number : 10
Enter Second number : 6
Quotient obtained is  : 1
Remainder obtained is : 4

a. Check whether function/values is callable or not .

Function used is callable
Value 10 is not callable 
Value 6 is not callable 

b. Check whether all the values are non zeroes or not .

None of the given values and the quotient and remainder obtaineed is zero .

c. Add values (4, 5, 6) to the result and filter out the values which are greater than 4.

The filtered values which are greater than 4 are  : [5, 6, 6, 10]

d. Convert the above result into set datatype.

The result that is of values greater than 4 is converted to set : {10, 5, 6}

e. Make that set immutable.

Set has been made immutable.

f. Evaluate the maximum value from set and find out its hash value

Maximum value in  the set is  10

Hash values for the  maximum value according to the considerration :
if it is considered as a integer then : 10
if it is considered as a string then : -1214220614461833776
